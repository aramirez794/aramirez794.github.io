# Synopsis
Battlefield 4 is a Single-player first person shooter and the Campaign takes place during the 
fictional "War of 2020", six years after the events of Battlefield 3. Meanwhile Russia is giving China 
full support in case if a war breaks out with the United States. I honestly played just about an hour 
of the story mode and then I jumped straight to the multiplayer mode and made most of my critique from 
the multiplayer mode.

# Game Play Summary
The multiplayer mode that I played mostly in for this game critique is the Conquest mode which is an open 
world map and the main objective is to capture a specific landmark throughout the map and whichever team 
has the most landmarks secured wins. There are different classes in battlfield such as Assault, Engineer,
Recon and Support. If I wanted to get up close and personal then I would choose the Assault class and have
a medkit at my side while I played. The cool thing about Battlefield 4 is the destructible environment you 
can use to your advantage. 

Bullet drops is the next thing you notice that battlefield has to offer especially when is comes down to the 
Recon class. After playing a couple of games as a sniper in the Recon class, I'd notice that i would have to 
always aim above my enemies head from at least 300 yards away, anything closer you could always just aim for 
the head.
