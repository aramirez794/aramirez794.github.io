# Heroku

   Heroku is useful tool to implement CI solutions such as adding pipelines which can help
  to help organize a project for production. A great thing about Heroku is that we can connect
  our Github accounts and run tests on every push to that we do on GitHub with Heroku CI.
  
   Another great thing about Heroku is that you can use several languages for that program such as Java, Ruby
   Python, Elixar and several other langueges. Heroku is great for debugging since it inspects Heroku
   CI environment and executes tests inside a test dyno.
