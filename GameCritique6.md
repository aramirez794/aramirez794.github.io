# Synopsis
Overcooked is a chaotic one to four multiplayer game where you play as a chef
and your job is to fulfill the customers food order so you prepare their meals 
using ingredients provided on the level you play. After a customer is finsihed 
with their meal, you must take their dirty dish and clean them in order to 
continue the level in a short amount of time.

# Game Play Summary
Each level you play will have a different effect on your gameplay since the levels
have interactive environments, you can have a level where your playing in a kitchen,
another level were your playing on a crowded street and also on a ship at sea. You're
first started off with the customers order and then you proceed to gather the right 
ingredients for that order. Some levels provide table counters where you can place
extra ingredients and some other levels dont provide any counters so your given little 
room to work with. If you dont complete the customer's order within a certain amount of 
time, the customer will become upset and they'll leave which will affect your overall
score.

your friends since you guys can work as a team and get the orders out alot faster and
more organized.
### Controls
Controls are very simple and straight forward.

# Final Thoughts
Overall gameplay is chaotic in such a fun way making every level a challenge and coming up
with new strategies to complete the level comes with great satisfaction. I tried playing the 
game by myself and I could barely get passed the 4th level, with me having to take care of all
of the duties I was finding myself mixing up alot of orders and having alot of customers leave. 
I was able to have my girlfriend play alongside with me and we were able to get passed alot farther
than I originally had done by myself so working alongside teammates will help tremondously and this 
games makes players communicate with each other in order to have a faster more organized workflow 
for a higher overall score.
