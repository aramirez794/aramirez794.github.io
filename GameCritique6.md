# Synopsis
Overcooked is a chaotic one to four multiplayer game where you play as a chef
and your job is to fulfill the customers food order so you prepare their meals 
using ingredients provided on the level you play. After a customer is finsihed 
with their meal, you must take their dirty dish and clean them in order to 
continue the level in a short amount of time.

# Game Play Summary
Each level you play will have a different effect on your gameplay since the levels
have interactive environments, you can have a level where your playing in a kitchen,
another level were your playing on a crowded street and also on a ship at sea. You're
first started off with the customers order and then you proceed to gather the right 
ingredients for that order. Some levels provide table counters where you can place

time, the customer will become upset and they'll leave which will affect your overall
