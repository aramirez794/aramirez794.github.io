## Test Steps: 
| # | Description | Expected Result | Check (√) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |Only works in sotry mode |Games cannot be saved in build mode | |			
| 2 |The file name for the game must be valid so it can be read back  in at a later time. |Strange  characters  in  the  file  name  make cause  problems  when opening the file for loading | |			
| 3 |If the file already exists, the file will be written over. |If the user is trying to save the game with the same file name then it is probably a continuation of that previously saved game. | |			
| 4 |If the file doesn’t exist it must be created. |The game can’t write to a file that’s not there | |			
| 5 |The  file  must  be  saved  in  a particular  format  and  include  all  the  game data that needs to be read back in at a later time so the game can continue |If the file isn’t in a certain format then the game won’t be able to load 
all the information back in at a later date | |
