# Synopsis
First Person 3D puzzle game, the player progresses through each section of the 
island solving maze like puzzles on panels that are scattered throughout the island.

# Game Play Summary
The player is in First person view and you start the game off in a dark hallway with a 
door in the distance, once you open the door you'll be revealed with a beautiful vibrant
open-world game with numurous man-made structures that contain mazed puzzles scattered 
throughout the island. Some of the maze puzzles in different areas of the world will require 
you to use the environment in order to solve a puzzle-- some cases you'll have  to listen 
to your surrounding in order to solve a puzzle. 

A great example of listening to your environment that I found pretty intersting was when I
was in a section of the island that had a garden maze and the floor for the garden maze had 
dirt/rubble so with every step you'd take you could hear your footsteps on the rubble and if 
you were to walk in the wrong direction of the maze then the noise of the rubble/dirt would
stop, but if you follow the noise of the rubble/dirt you'll then approach another maze puzzle
which in this case the puzzle would be designed as the garden mazed you're currently in and 
in order to solve it you'll just have to trace  out the path you took while listening to your
footsteps. It's something you might not catch at first but you'll soon realize you'll have to
use the sound of your environments for specific maze puzzles in order to solve them.
