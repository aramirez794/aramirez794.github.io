#  Game Review
I'll be reviewing a puzzle-platformer horror-adventure game called Little Nightmares.

# Summary

This game is about a little girl named Six is trapped in the Maw - which is a mysterious place
that has alot of weird creatures there, and she must escape that place while avoiding from dying of hunger.
After playing for a couple of hours I found a couple of functions that testers probably would have had a look at.

1. In the game the player is able to light up a candle in order to help her view her surroundings since the overall game 
takes place mostly in dark eerie rooms so having to test out the brightness of the candle would have been a function that a
tester would have looked at making sure it isnt too bright or too dark but just enough to light the player's way.
