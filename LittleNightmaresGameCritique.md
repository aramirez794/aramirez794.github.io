#  Game Review
I'll be reviewing a puzzle-platformer horror-adventure game called Little Nightmares.

# Summary

This game is about a little girl named Six who is trapped in the Maw - which is a mysterious place
that has alot of weird creatures there, and she must escape that place while avoiding from dying of hunger.
After playing for a couple of hours I found a couple of functions that testers probably would have had a look at.

1. In the game the player is able to light up a candle in order to help her view her surroundings since the overall game 
takes place mostly in dark eerie rooms so having to test out the brightness of the candle would have been a function that a
tester would have looked at making sure it isnt too bright or too dark but just enough to light the player's way.

2. Another function that a tester probably would have tested is the sprint speed of the character. There are scenarios
when you're running away from an enemy and i felt at points the player was too slow, but over time I found that I just had to time my escape route perfectly in order to escape the enemies grasp, so having to test the speed of the character was probably another 
function that was tested.

3. And lastly another function that was tested was the enemies AI awareness for the player. It's kinda hard to look 
around the room when there's an enemy wandering around and if you tend to walk towards open space in the game, the enemy can
somehow "sniff you out" and he will know the exact location of where you're at. So hiding is the key to the game and having the 
AI awarness very high allows the player to be more stealthy and careful.


# Bugs

On the 3rd chapter of the game, I was walking down a hall until I noticed some sort of glitch on the wall of the hallway 
which made the wall seem to have a giant hole in the wall.




The glitch would only happen if you passed a certain part in front of the wall, other than that the wall would just look normal.



# Final Thoughts

I haven't completed this game yet but it's a very eerie intriguing game so far that i'd highly recommend playing. I was glad I chose this game since I have never played it before and I was lucky enough to find a small bug/glitch in the game.
