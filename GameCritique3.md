# Synopsis
One day, 98% of Earth's population suddenly disappeared, and the remaining population found themselves surrounded by humanoid zombie-like creatures that were created by dark dense clouds in the sky. The survivors must find a way to survive the storm by creating "storm shields" which can reduce the attacks from the enemies, and use these to set up survivor bases across the globe. The player is a commander of one of these bases, charged with going out of the storm shield to find resources, survivors, and other allies to help expand their storm shield and find a way to return Earth to normal.

# Game Play Summary
The mode that I played in was called Battle Royale, and in this mode you start off in a lobby full of 100 other players that are all in a
bus thats flying across the map and you have the choice of to jump out from the bus whenever you want on the map, and as you jump out you'll descend towards ground level and from there is where you start looting and scavenging for supplies and weapons and try to be the last survivor. As you loot around the map and gather weapons, you can also use a Pick axe that your player possesses to gather supplies such as wood, stone, and metal and with these supplies you can build yourself forts, walls, stairs and traps and use this build function to your advantage when going up against enemies. You will always have to be on high alert for other players around you since they can kill you and loot all of your supplies that you worked hard for to find, and in the case if an enemy starts shooting at you and you need immediete cover, you can easily build yourself walls around you and create a little fort to help you get away from the enemies fire and also heal yourself.

During the game there is a constant storm that starts closing in around the map which forces players to all head towards the center of the map where the storm cant reach and from there thats where gameplay and fort building gets more intense. Once it reaches down to 5 players you'll have a more close combat shooting and whoever survives from those 5 players wins the whole match.
# Playability
### Single/Multiplayer
Fortnite single player mode is fun to play and fun to explore the map but this game also provides multiplayer where you can team up with a friend and go on head to head with other teams to become the top 1.

### Controls

# Bugs
There weren't too many bugs that i found while playing fortite but there were times where the servers were slow and I would have bad lag and it would be difficult to aim my weapon which would cause me to die all the time. 
# Final Thoughts
My final thoughts of the game was great. Even though this game is just a beta, this games provides a different kind of survival shooter that has a fun building mechanic and a pretty smart game concept. Although the shooting and aiming of the game sometimes is hard to use, with a little bit of practice on the bullet drops and aiming, you can definitely become a deadly target. I really like the idea on how the storm gets larger and that causes the players to all move to a certain small part of the map where they wont be affected by the storm, by doing this this will cause alot of players who like to camp out and just snipe or hide forever, leave their hiding spots and forces them to act on the go and not to get too comfortable at one spot of the map.
