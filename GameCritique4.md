# Synopsis
Hitman Go is a turned-based puzzle video game which uses elements from the original Hitman
video game series. Each level is layed out with a grid pattern that the player must use to 
complete each level.

# Game Play Summary
Each level will require the player to complete a main objective while there are some levels 
that would require the player to assassinate a specific target. In order to dispatch a target, the
player must move into the space that the enemy is occupying, similar to a game of chess. 

There are levels that have items such as a rock or a sniper rifle that you can use to your 
advantage in order to progress through the level. Using the rock will cause a distaction so
your're able to select a certain distance from your players location on the grid to throw the
rock, after throwing the rock, that action would cause nearby enemies to be alerted and they'll
go and inspect the area leaving their post that they're guarding. And of course with the sniper 
rifle you can just easily dispatch an enemy from a distance.

Each level also have side challenges such as completing the level with a few turns, collect a 
briefcase and complete the level, and lastly complete the level without killing anyone. Having these 
side objectives makes the gameplay a bit more fun, it allows the player to play the game 
a bit longer and it adds more challenges to the level.

# Final Thoughts
After playing Hitman Go, I was impressed on the approach that they came out for this game since most 
of the Hitman series games are in an open world game and Hitman Go is more of a top down board game. 
Having elements of Hitman such as the distractions and weapons kept the gameplay fun and discovering 
each new "board/map" was fun and made me anxious to see what the next puzzle would be like. There were
times that I got stuck on a level and I wasn't too sure on what I had to do, so I was able to skip that 
level and continue onto the next level and I could return back to the level that I couldnt complete at 
a later time.
