# Final Thoughts
The overall gameplay was similar to the other game that I critiqued on which was Hitman Go and it was 
a pretty cool relaxing game to play. The gameplay's music is very ambient and calm and there are times 
when you can hear the wind gustling through the bushes and plants throughout the game. Controls felt
very smooth and I was really digging the art style of the whole game.
